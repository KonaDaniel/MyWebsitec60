    <section id="about">
        <p> Coding is the process of using a programming language to get a computer to behave how you want it to. Every line of code tells the computer to do something, and a document full of lines of code is called a script. Each script is designed to carry out a job. This job might be to take an image and change its size.So now that you know what Codign is Ever since the day I was able to write my first lines of code It opened up a world where we would be able to solve world wide problems all with simple lines of code.This is what I love about coding it shows that young kids like me are able to solve world wide problems.</p>
